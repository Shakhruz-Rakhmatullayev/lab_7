# HabitFlow

HabitFlow is a Flutter app for tracking habits and fitness. It has a glass-style interface, light and dark themes, and four screens in a floating bottom navigation bar.

## Features

- **Home**: a greeting, a search bar, today's stats (steps, calories burnt and more) with progress indicators, quick-toggle chips for today's habits, and a featured workout card.
- **Habits**: a scrollable date strip, a summary card with a progress ring, and the habit list. You can mark habits done, which updates their streaks, add new habits with a custom icon, color and time of day, or remove them.
- **Statistics**: recent workout charts for calories and duration, plus a habit-consistency heatmap.
- **Profile**: personal metrics (age, height, weight) and an editable profile. Settings cover reminder time, sound, notifications, appearance (system, light or dark), experience level, caution areas and units.
- **Saved settings**: the theme, sound, notification, experience, reminder and caution-area settings are stored with `shared_preferences`, so they stay the same between launches.

## Tech stack

- Flutter (Dart SDK `^3.13.2`)
- State management with `ChangeNotifier` and an `InheritedNotifier` scope (`AppScope`)
- [`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) for storage
- Custom painters for the progress rings, pill bar charts and wave graphics
